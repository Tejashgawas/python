The "RoboSpeaker" project is a simple Python script that utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text input into speech output. Upon running the script, the user is greeted with a welcome message. The program then enters a continuous loop, prompting the user to enter text to be spoken by the "RoboSpeaker". The user can type any text they desire, and upon pressing Enter, the program converts the text to speech using the text_to_speech function and plays it back to the user.

The user has the option to exit the program by typing "q" (case-insensitive). If the user inputs "q", the program speaks "bye bye friend." and gracefully exits the loop, terminating the program execution.

Overall, the "RoboSpeaker" project provides a simple and interactive way for users to convert text input into speech output, offering a basic demonstration of text-to-speech functionality using Python and pyttsx3.
